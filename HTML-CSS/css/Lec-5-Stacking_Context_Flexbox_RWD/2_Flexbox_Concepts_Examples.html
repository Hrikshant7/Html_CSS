    Limitation to use Float property: (To create the layouts)
        -> causes the problem of overlapping.
        -> floats doesn't work well for responsive designs, as they don't automatically adjust 
           their position based different screen sizes.
        
        To overcome this above float problem
    
    What is flexbox?
        -> It's modern way to create the responsive layouts. It is used more in the IT industry frontend projects.
        -> because it provides more powerful and flexible ways to create the complex layouts and 
          also it is supported by maximum modern web browser. 
    How to create the flexbox/ flexible box layout?
        -> If you are going to create flexbox, then a flexbox container is required
           you can cretae it via display: flex;
        -> You want to create and put your elements in flexbox container:
            vertical alignment (cross-axis) -> align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | basline | stretch
            horizontal alignment (main-axis) -> justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-evenly | space-between | space-around
        ->  flex items styling:
             can use these properties like width, height, color, font size, background-color

        -> If the number flex items are more than than the flex container size then it will overflow:
           you can flex-wrap: wrap | no-wrap and gap: 10px is used to controlling the space b/w the items.
        
        ->  You feel the repsonsive and appealing layouts that you are going to create via flexbox.
