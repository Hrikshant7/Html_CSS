    Minfication: Removing the the characters like whitespace and comments 
                 from the files (HTML, CSS, JS) to reduce their file sizes and 
                 can improve the loading time. 
                 Tools need to use at the dev level: Use VS code IDE extention as "MinifyAll"
    Uglification: chnage the name of functions and varibales to minimize the charactres used. (Script files, CSS files)
    Compression: Reducing the size of the assets using a compression technique:
                       eg: images and videos
                    1. Technique: generally enabled the gzip or brotli used for compression
                    2. CDN(Content Delivery network):
